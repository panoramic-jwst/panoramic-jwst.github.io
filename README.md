# PANORAMIC JWST Survey Page

PANORAMIC is a Pure Parallel Wide Area Legacy Imaging Survey at 1-5 Micron approved in JWST Cycle 1 as Proposal #2514

The main motivation for conducting this pure parallel survey was: Where HST has characterized the UV universe to z=6-7 and beyond, JWST is designed to take the crucial next step and characterize the UV universe to z=12-15 (a factor of 2 in expansion rate), at only ~300 Myr after the Big Bang where we expect the first galaxies to form. Additionally, JWST for the first time allows studies of the restframe optical emission to z=10, a huge leap from the current z=3 (HST). To fully capitalize on JWST's unparalleled imaging AND spectroscopic capabilities, it is critical, however, to find the most precious intrinsically luminous candidate galaxies early in the mission. Large area imaging is thus needed from day one. With a pure parallel survey we probe unique discovery space with uncorrelated, bias-free, wide-area imaging at 1-5micron. These data overcome two major outstanding limitations in our current extragalactic census using yet-undiscovered populations: (1) the brightest and most distant sources that ended the cosmic Dark Ages at z>9 and (2) red sources at z>~3.

The survey obtained a total of ~530 sq arcmin of NIRCam imaging from 1-5micron, totaling ~192 hours of science integration time. This represents the largest on-sky time investment of any Cycle 1 GO extragalactic NIRCam imaging program by nearly a factor of 2x. The survey includes ~432 sq arcmin of novel sky area not yet observed with JWST using at least 6 NIRCam broad-band filters, increasing the existing area covered by similar Cycle 1 data by ~60%. 70 square arcmin was also covered by a 7th filter (F410M).
